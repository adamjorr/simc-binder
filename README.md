# simc-binder
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/adamjorr/simc-binder/master?filepath=index.ipynb)

A binder repository for using Simulationcraft.

Click the button above to launch a binder instance.
This will give you a jupyter notebook containing a widget where you can paste your simc 
script and press enter to have it run the simulation in the cloud, much like a less 
sophisticated version of [raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot).
After the sim is finished, a link to the output report will appear below the button.

The notebook may not initialize with the widget functioning properly; if this happens open 
the "Cell" menu in the top left and click "Run All". Then paste your script and press enter 
or click the button.
