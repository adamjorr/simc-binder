# simc-binder
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/adamjorr/simc-binder/master?urlpath=apps%2Findex.ipynb)

A binder repository for using Simulationcraft.

Click the button above to launch a binder instance.
This will give you a  web app containing a widget where you 
can paste your simc script and click the button to run the simulation in the cloud, much like a less 
sophisticated version of [raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot).
After the sim is finished, a link to the output report will appear below the button.
